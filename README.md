## Props:

- Props is just like Attributes for javascript. 

- React props (properties) facillate data transfer from parent to child components.

- Data flows unidirectionally, ensuring a clear direction of information in React app.

- Props are immutable, meaning child components cannot modify the data received from parents.

- Child components access props through their function parameters.

- You can also pass JSX as props to another component.
